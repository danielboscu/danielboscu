1st computer owned: Some old HP desktop when I was 6 years old. Funny story about that desktop -- our repairman stole our 1TB hard drive and replaced it with 100 GB, and we didn't know that up until one year later. People who had a desktop in the early 2010s know how much a hard drive like that used to cost. *D :*
